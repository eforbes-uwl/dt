DuctTape: A High-level Assembler for RISC-V
===========================================

DuctTape (dt) is a high-level assembly programming language and assembler for the RISC-V instruction set. It is intended to be used during the early development stages of hardware and software tools, to aid developers in writing micro-kernel test cases for exposing bugs, exercising specific code sequences, and/or for performance validation.

If you use dt in your own research, please consider citing our MICS paper cited below. And if you find dt helpful, please let me know (eforbes@uwlax.edu) - I'd like to have a rough idea of how many people have tried it.
